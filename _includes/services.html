                    <h3 class="section-subheading1 text-muted"><b>Cloud Computing is a new paradigm in Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) that transforms “computing as a resource” to “computing as a service”. It is a disruptive technology with influence pervading across all aspects of a modern economy. While this has the potential of leapfrogging the economy of emerging markets like India, the adoption and deployment in such countries poses a unique set of technological, business, and regulatory challenges. The current state of IT deployment (refer UN e-Governance survey—India is ranked 124) indicates that India has a near greenfield opportunity of developing cloud-based solutions that can leverage the latest technology and be optimally suited to the unique requirements of emerging markets. There is deep expertise available across the R&D Labs, academia and government labs in various technology areas associated with cloud computing. However, they have been primarily operating in isolation.

                    CCICI and IEEE joint workshop on “Cloud Computing Innovations in India: A Framework and Road” is aimed at bringing together subject matter experts across government, industry, and academia to collaborate and innovate with the objective of accelerating the emergence of the Indian IT ecosystem as a strong “global leader” in Cloud Computing technologies for emerging markets.</b></h3>
