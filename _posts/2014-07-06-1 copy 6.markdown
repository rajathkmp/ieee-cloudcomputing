Starting with research work on designing and developing networking protocols, I worked on designing network architecture, IT Consulting and Strategic consulting for defining long-term strategic vision to achieve their objectives of improving quality of service delivery to all stakeholders. As part of Corporate Technology Innovation, I am working on Enablement of new technologies being Explored by different Innovation Labs as well as Co-innovation Partners. These solutions are then offered to Clients testing their new business concepts (Evangelize & Exploit Groups – 2 of the 4E Model of TCS). Currently developing prototyping & simulation factory platform to offer Lean Start-up Style “Experimentation-as-a-Service” to test business viability of innovative hypothesis / concepts followed by technical feasibility of selected ideas.  The Factory focusses on rapidly creating solution prototypes and conducting “thought experiments” to simulate outcomes from perspectives of all stakeholders, both internal and external.As Chairman of the Working Group for definition of standards and architectures for adoption of cloud-centric applications and related technology landscape, I am providing Advisory services to Government, CCICI and working with other technology partners, academia and research organisations.

I also worked on IT Infrastructure and Strategic Consulting study projects defining prioritised list of IT Initiatives for the next 5 years. At Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Hong Kong, I worked as network consultant for designing network architecture, delivering network consulting services and training sessions on networking technologies. Incomnet Inc was my first company after completing my engineering degree in 1984.  In this company, I developed systems software and network protocols for computer networks.  The projects included development of device drivers for disks and network protocols, and customization of Operating Systems (both networked and Real-Time OS) developed in PASCAL, C & Assembly Language.  The software development effort was part of designing complete communication switches involving all hardware, operating systems as well as message switching systems.
